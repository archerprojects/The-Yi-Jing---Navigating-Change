# The YiJing (I Ching) — Navigating Change

A desktop oracle for consulting the YiJing (I Ching) — 易經, "The Book of Changes" —
Cast a hexagram by coin or yarrow stalk, read it across five sources —
three classic translations, the original Chinese text, and the Ten Wings —
and keep a private reading journal — all in one offline Linux application.

## Purpose

The YiJing is an ancient Chinese text used as a guide for reflection on change.
Its structure is 64 hexagrams, each built from six lines that are either broken
(yin) or unbroken (yang). A question is brought to the oracle, a hexagram is cast,
and the result — together with any moving lines and the hexagram it changes into —
is read for insight.

*Navigating Change* makes that process self-contained and unhurried: it casts
authentically, presents the reading clearly, and records it, without needing a
network connection or any external service.

## Features

- **Two casting methods.** Coin toss (every line type equally likely) and the older
  yarrow-stalk method, which weights the lines unequally (Old Yin is rare — 1 in 16).
  The yarrow cast is animated stalk by stalk.
- **Manual cast entry.** Enter a hexagram by hand when you have cast off-screen.
- **Five reading sources.** Richard Wilhelm (tr. Cary F. Baynes), James Legge, and
  Bradford Hatcher — plus the original Chinese text (中文) of the Zhouyi and the
  Ten Wings (十翼) commentaries in Chinese with Legge's translation — switchable
  per reading, with a full book reader panel.
- **Primary and relating hexagrams.** Moving lines and the resulting hexagram are
  shown side by side, with upper/lower trigram detail.
- **Reading journal.** Per-profile entries capturing the question, purpose, mood,
  weather, moon phase, and the cast result.
- **Trigram lookup and study.** Browse all 64 hexagrams and the eight trigrams.
  The study section also carries the five Ten Wings treatises complete — the
  Great Treatise I & II (繫辭), the Discussion of the Trigrams (說卦), the Sequence
  (序卦), and the Hexagrams in Irregular Order (雜卦) — bilingually.
- **Profiles.** Multiple consulting profiles, plus a Guest mode that does not journal.

## Architecture

The application is built with **Python 3 / PySide6** (Qt for Python). Translation
texts and the book reader are rendered as HTML through **QWebEngineView**. Coins,
yarrow stalks, and hexagram figures are drawn with **QPainter**. Reading data is
stored locally per profile.

### Source layout

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `yijing_main.py` | Main window, layout and mode switching, `HexDisplay`, hex-panel sizing, reading flow. Holds the app-identity block (`APP_NAME`, `APP_VER`, `APP_ID`) — the single source of truth for version and ID. |
| `cast.py` | Cast panel and coin engine: `CastPanel`, coin cast panel, `CoinWidget`, `LineWidget`, coin-image loader. |
| `yarrow_animation.py` | Yarrow panel and animated stalk-sorting widget. |
| `coin_images.py` | Base64-encoded cash-coin animation frames. |
| `journal.py` | Reading journal, profiles, entry storage, moon-phase calculation. |
| `hexfig.py` | SVG hexagram-figure injection into book HTML. |
| `widgets.py` | `ZoomView` (a `QWebEngineView` subclass) used by the reader. |
| `build.sh` | Generic build script. Reads version and app ID from `yijing_main.py`; produces the PyInstaller bundle and the Flatpak. |

### Runtime assets

The following assets are bundled into the Flatpak at build time and are **required to
build a working application**:

- `book/`, `content/` — reader sources (Wilhelm, Legge, Hatcher, 中文, Ten Wings) and study content
- `opening_image.png`, `opening_image_wo_text.png`, `swirl.png` — artwork
- `ukai_yijing.ttf` — AR PL UKai CN subset (CJK body text)
- `aoyagi_yijing.ttf` — Aoyagi Reisho SIMO subset (clerical-script headings); its
  author's distribution documents accompany it and must remain in the repository
- `icon_64.png`, `icon_128.png`, `icon_256.png` — application icons

> **Note for contributors:** assets live alongside the source in this repository.
> If you obtain the source without the `book/`, `content/`, font, and image assets,
> the build will complete but the application will be missing its translations,
> artwork, and CJK font.

## Building

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12**
- **PySide6** (Qt 6, including QtWebEngine)
- **PyInstaller 6.20** or newer
- **flatpak** and **flatpak-builder**
- The **freedesktop runtime and SDK 25.08**:

  ```sh
  flatpak install flathub org.freedesktop.Platform//25.08 org.freedesktop.Sdk//25.08
  ```

### Build and install

From the project directory:

```sh
rm -rf dist build *.spec && ./build.sh
```

`build.sh` reads the version and Flatpak ID directly from `yijing_main.py`, runs
PyInstaller, packages the Flatpak (`YiJingNavigatingChange-<version>-x86_64.flatpak`),
and installs it. No paths or version numbers are hardcoded in the script — bumping
`APP_VER` in `yijing_main.py` is the only change needed to version a release.

### Run

After installation:

```sh
flatpak run io.archerprojects.YiJingNavigatingChange
```
